# VPS hosting

This hub links to the supported VPS/hosting guides and explains how cloud
deployments work at a high level.

## Pick a provider

- **Railway** (one‑click + browser setup): [Railway](/install/railway)
- **Northflank** (one‑click + browser setup): [Northflank](/install/northflank)
- **Oracle Cloud (Always Free)**: [Oracle](/platforms/oracle) — $0/month (Always Free, ARM; capacity/signup can be finicky)
- **Fly.io**: [Fly.io](/install/fly)
- **Hetzner (Docker)**: [Hetzner](/install/hetzner)
- **GCP (Compute Engine)**: [GCP](/install/gcp)
- **exe.dev** (VM + HTTPS proxy): [exe.dev](/install/exe-dev)
- **AWS (EC2/Lightsail/free tier)**: works well too. Video guide:

## How cloud setups work

- The **Gateway runs on the VPS** and owns state + workspace.
- You connect from your laptop/phone via the **Control UI** or **Tailscale/SSH**.
- Treat the VPS as the source of truth and **back up** the state + workspace.
- Secure default: keep the Gateway on loopback and access it via SSH tunnel or Tailscale Serve.
  If you bind to `lan`/`tailnet`, require `gateway.auth.token` or `gateway.auth.password`.

Remote access: [Gateway remote](/gateway/remote)

## Remote access with a VPS

Keep the Gateway in the cloud and operate it from your laptop/desktop over secure
remote access (Control UI, SSH tunnel, or Tailscale).
